    "# Pokémon Rebalancing Tool - Project Documentation\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Project Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The Pokémon Rebalancing Tool is a comprehensive application designed for Pokémon enthusiasts, fan game creators, and ROM hackers who want to experiment with and rebalance Pokémon stats, types, and abilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "What began as a simple Python script to generate an Excel spreadsheet has evolved into a robust, interactive web application. This final version provides a seamless and user-friendly interface for editing Pokémon data, viewing changes in real-time, and exporting custom creations, all without the limitations of file-locking or formatting issues inherent in the previous Excel-based workflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "The core of the project is a powerful web-based editor that runs locally in your browser, using a pre-populated JSON file as its database.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. File Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "The project is organized into a logical folder structure. To function correctly, your main project folder should look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "/Pokemon_Rebalancing_Project/\n",
    "|\n",
    "|-- script/\n",
    "|   |-- pokeeditor.js        # The main application logic\n",
    "|\n",
    "|-- styles/\n",
    "|   |-- pokeeditor.css       # All visual styling for the app\n",
    "|\n",
    "|-- index.html               # The main HTML file you open\n",
    "|-- pokemon_cache.json       # The database of all Pokémon\n",
    "|\n",
    "|-- (Optional) pokedata.py   # Python script to generate/update the cache\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### File Descriptions\n",
    "\n",
    "* **`index.html`**: The main file for the web application. This is the only file you need to open in your browser to use the tool. It contains the basic structure of the page.\n",
    "* **`script/pokeeditor.js`**: This JavaScript file contains all the interactive logic for the application. It handles loading the data, displaying Pokémon, calculating stats, and managing your custom creations.\n",
    "* **`styles/pokeeditor.css`**: This CSS file contains all the visual styling rules, including the colors for Pokémon types and the conditional formatting for stats.\n",
    "* **`pokemon_cache.json`**: This is the heart of the application's data. It's a large JSON file containing the stats, types, and abilities for every Pokémon and its variants. The web app reads this file on startup.\n",
    "* **`pokedata.py` (Optional)**: This Python script is a powerful utility used to generate the `pokemon_cache.json` file from scratch by fetching the latest data from the online PokéAPI. You only need to run this script if you want to update your Pokémon database with new generations or if the cache file is missing.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Setup & Installation\n",
    "\n",
    "Follow these steps to get the tool running on your local machine.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 1: Generating the Pokémon Database (One-Time Setup)\n",
    "\n",
    "If you already have the `pokemon_cache.json` file, you can skip to Step 2. If not, you need to generate it using the Python script.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Prerequisites**: Ensure you have Python installed on your computer.\n",
    "2.  **Install Libraries**: Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command to install the necessary Python libraries:\n",
    "    ```bash\n",
    "    pip install pandas requests openpyxl\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "3.  **Run the Script**: Place the `pokedata.py` script in your main project folder and run it from your terminal:\n",
    "    ```bash\n",
    "    python pokedata.py\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    This process will take several minutes as it fetches data for every Pokémon. Once complete, it will create the essential `pokemon_cache.json` file in the same folder.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 2: Using the Web Application\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Organize Files**: Ensure your files are arranged in the structure described in the \"File Structure\" section above.\n",
    "2.  **Open the Application**: Simply drag the `index.html` file into your web browser, or right-click it and choose \"Open with\" your preferred browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.).\n",
    "3.  **Start Editing**: The tool is now ready to use!\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. How to Use the Rebalancing Tool\n",
    "\n",
    "The web interface is designed to be intuitive and efficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Selecting a Pokémon**: Use the main dropdown menu at the top to select a Pokémon. The list contains all official Pokémon and any custom versions you have created.\n",
    "* **Viewing Data**: The \"Original\" column will populate with the current stats, types, and abilities of the selected Pokémon.\n",
    "* **Editing**: Use the input fields in the \"Edited\" column to make your changes.\n",
    "    * **Leaving a field blank** will cause it to default to the original value when you commit. You only need to change the values you want to be different.\n",
    "    * The **\"Calculated BST\"** will update in real-time as you enter new stat values.\n",
    "* **Committing Changes**: Click the \"Commit Changes\" button to save your new version of the Pokémon.\n",
    "    * If this is the first time you've edited this Pokémon, it will be added to the \"Custom Pokémon List\".\n",
    "    * If you are re-editing a Pokémon that's already in the custom list, this will **overwrite and update** your previous custom version.\n",
    "* **The Custom List**: The list on the right shows all the Pokémon you have modified. You can click on any Pokémon in this list to instantly load it back into the editor for further tweaking and balance patching.\n",
    "* **Downloading Your Work**: Click the \"Download Custom Data (JSON)\" button at any time to save a `custom_pokemon.json` file containing all of your creations. This is a great way to back up your work or share it with others.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. Troubleshooting\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Visual Glitches (Incorrect Colors or Layout)**:\n",
    "    * The most common cause is an issue with the stylesheet. Verify that the `styles/pokeeditor.css` file is in the correct folder and that the `<link>` tag in `index.html` points to the right path.\n",
    "    * Browser extensions, particularly \"Dark Mode\" themes, can interfere with the application's custom colors. Try disabling such extensions for the tool's page to see if that restores the intended appearance.\n",
    "* **The application shows a \"pokemon_cache.json not found\" error**:\n",
    "    * This means the `pokemon_cache.json` file is not in the correct location. It should be in the main project folder, at the same level as `index.html`.\n",
    "    * If you don't have the file, you need to run the `pokedata.py` script to generate it.\n"
