    "# Pokémon Rebalancing Tool - Project Documentation\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Project Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The Pokémon Rebalancing Tool is a comprehensive application designed for Pokémon enthusiasts, fan game creators, and ROM hackers who want to experiment with and rebalance Pokémon stats, types, and abilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project evolved from a Python script and Excel-based workflow into a robust, interactive web application. The final version provides a seamless user interface for editing Pokémon data, viewing changes in real-time, and exporting custom creations for personal use or for patching into a GBA ROM via HexManiacAdvance.\n",
    "\n",
    "The core of the project is a powerful web-based editor that runs locally in your browser, using a pre-populated JSON file as its database.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. File Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "To function correctly, your main project folder should be organized as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "/Pokemon_Rebalancing_Project/\n",
    "|\n",
    "|-- script/\n",
    "|   |-- pokeeditor.js        # The main application logic\n",
    "|\n",
    "|-- styles/\n",
    "|   |-- pokeeditor.css       # All visual styling for the app\n",
    "|\n",
    "|-- (Optional Utilities)/\n",
    "|   |-- generate_cache.py    # Python script to generate the database\n",
    "|   |-- export_to_excel.py   # Python script to export JSON to Excel\n",
    "|   |-- json_to_hma.py       # Python script to create HMA patches\n",
    "|\n",
    "|-- index.html               # The main HTML file you open\n",
    "|-- pokemon_cache.json       # The database of all Pokémon (Generated by generate_cache.py)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### File Descriptions\n",
    "\n",
    "* **`index.html`**: The main file for the web application. This is the only file you need to open in your browser to use the tool.\n",
    "* **`script/pokeeditor.js`**: Contains all the interactive logic for the application, such as loading data, displaying Pokémon, and managing your custom edits.\n",
    "* **`styles/pokeeditor.css`**: Contains all visual styling rules, including the colors for Pokémon types and the conditional formatting for stats.\n",
    "* **`pokemon_cache.json`**: The heart of the application's data. It's a large JSON file containing the data for every Pokémon and its variants.\n",
    "* **`(Optional Utilities)`**: A folder containing the Python scripts for backend tasks.\n",
    "    * **`generate_cache.py`**: A one-time script to generate the `pokemon_cache.json` file from the online PokéAPI.\n",
    "    * **`export_to_excel.py`**: A utility to convert a JSON file of Pokémon data into a formatted Excel spreadsheet.\n",
    "    * **`json_to_hma.py`**: A powerful utility that converts your final JSON data into a `.tfl` script for use with HexManiacAdvance.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Setup & Installation\n",
    "\n",
    "Follow these steps to get the tool running on your local machine.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 1: Generate the Pokémon Database (One-Time Setup)\n",
    "\n",
    "The application requires the `pokemon_cache.json` file. If you don't have this file, you must generate it.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Prerequisites**: Ensure you have Python 3 installed.\n",
    "2.  **Install Libraries**: Open your terminal or command prompt and run:\n",
    "    ```bash\n",
    "    pip install pandas requests openpyxl\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "3.  **Run the Script**: Navigate to the `(Optional Utilities)` folder and run the data generation script:\n",
    "    ```bash\n",
    "    python generate_cache.py\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    This will create the `pokemon_cache.json` file in your main project directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 2: Run the Web Application\n",
    "\n",
    "The application needs to be served by a local web server for the browser to allow it to load the JSON file.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Start the Server**: Open your terminal in the **root** of the project folder (the one containing `index.html`) and run Python's built-in web server:\n",
    "    ```bash\n",
    "    python -m http.server\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "2.  **Open the App**: Open your web browser and navigate to the following address:\n",
    "    [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)\n",
    "\n",
    "The Pokémon Rebalancing Tool should now be fully functional.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. How to Use the Rebalancing Tool\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Selecting a Pokémon**: Use the main dropdown menu to select a Pokémon. The list contains all official Pokémon and any custom versions you have created.\n",
    "* **Editing**: Use the input fields in the \"Edited\" column to make your changes. Any field left blank will automatically keep its original value when you commit.\n",
    "* **Committing Changes**: Click \"Commit Changes\" to save your modifications. This will add the Pokémon to the \"Custom Pokémon List\" on the right, or update it if it's already there.\n",
    "* **The Custom List**: This list shows all Pokémon you have modified. You can click on any Pokémon here to instantly load it back into the editor for further tweaking.\n",
    "* **Data Management**:\n",
    "    * **Upload Custom JSON**: Load a previously saved `custom_pokemon.json` file to resume a session.\n",
    "    * **Download Custom JSON**: Saves only your modified Pokémon. Perfect for saving your session.\n",
    "    * **Download Merged Data**: Exports the complete Pokémon dataset with your custom changes applied.\n",
    "    * **Download Base Data**: Gets a clean copy of the original dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. Advanced Workflow: Patching a ROM with HexManiacAdvance\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the end-goal for many users. The workflow connects the web tool to the ROM hacking tool.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Export from HMA**: Open your target ROM (e.g., Pokémon Unbound) in HexManiacAdvance. From the UI, copy the contents of the `pokemon.stats` and `abilities.names` tables and paste them into two separate text files: `pokemon.stats.txt` and `abilities.names.txt`.\n",
    "2.  **Create Your Patch**: Use the web application to make all your balance changes and download the `custom_pokemon.json` or `pokemon_merged_data.json` file.\n",
    "3.  **Generate the `.tfl` Script**: Run the `json_to_hma.py` utility. It will prompt you for your `.txt` and `.json` files and will generate a `balance_patch.tfl` file.\n",
    "4.  **Apply the Patch**: Open the generated `balance_patch.tfl` file, copy its contents, and paste them into the script editor in HexManiacAdvance to apply all your changes to the ROM automatically.\n"
